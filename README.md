# Traffic-light-controller
Designed a traffic light controller for a T-intersection in Xilinx Vivado, utilizing components such as FSM, flip-flops, counters, multiplexers, adders, comparators, clock dividers, I/O ports, decoders, and basic logic gates. The Verilog-based digital logic was employed to control the T-intersection traffic lights.
